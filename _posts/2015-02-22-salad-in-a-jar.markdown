I am Savanna Dreger and I am starting this blog to help teenagers like me learn how to make living gluten free more enjoyable. I will be including fun recipes, ways to cope with Celiac Disease or gluten intolerances, some experiences I have had throughout the years, and more! I hope people who read my blog will learn new tips and tricks for a better gluten free lifestyle.
My theme for this blog post is to not give up on your gluten free diet. It is totally worth it in the long run. It can be hard at times, but it gets easier and comes much more naturally. Today I am going to share how staying on the gluten free diet has been worth it to me.

I was first diagnosed with Celiac Disease three years ago. For an eleven year old that was not the best news. But over the years I have learned to deal with my gluten intolerance and actually got used to it pretty quickly. I started paying more attention to what I ate and got a lot healthier and a lot more pain free. I started growing and got a lot stronger. This was so worth it to me because I wasn’t malnourished anymore and I could do the things I liked without stomach pain.

## Todays Recipe: Salad in a Jar

What you will need:

- 1 Mason Jar with the lid
- 5 Cherry Tomatoes
- 2-4 Tablespoons of the dressing of your choice
- 1 small handful of the leafy greens of your choice

After this you can assort whatever vegetables you would like to put into the jar. I chose:  

- 1/2 Sliced Green Pepper (Or the pepper of your choice)
- 1/2 Cup of Broccoli
- 1/2 Cup of sliced carrot

### Directions:

- Put the 2-4 tablespoons of dressing in the bottom of your jar.
- Place the cherry tomatoes in the bottom of your jar along with the dressing.
- After this you can add in any vegetables you would like until the jar is a little less than ¾ of the way full.
- Add your leafy greens and either enjoy or put on the lid and save for later.

This simple recipe will be fresh for up to five days refrigerated.

I only use a little but of leafy greens because they are not always the most important part of a salad. The vegetables are! This recipe is also a super easy and simple gluten free snack.
